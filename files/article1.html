 <h3>2. Ray of hope: Serum Institute of India to make millions of potential coronavirus vaccine doses</h3>
<p>A potential vaccine against Covid-19 is under critical trial in Britain and the Serum Institute of India 
on Tuesday announced that it plans to produce up to 60 million doses this year. While the Oxford vaccine, <br>
called “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19”, is yet to be proven to protect against COVID-19 infection, Serum decided to start making it after it had shown 
pre-clinical promise and had progressed into human trials. Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla of serum said in a telephonic interview with Reuters said,<br> 
“They are a bunch of very qualified, great scientists (at Oxford), that’s why we said we will go with this and that’s why we are confident.
 Being a private limited company, not accountable to public investors or bankers, <br>
I can take a little risk and sideline some of the other commercial products and projects that I had planned in my existing facility.”<br>
 More than 100 potential COVID-19 candidate vaccines are now under development by biotech and research teams around the world.<br><br>
 </p><h3>3.High BMI in preschoolers linked to increased risk of fractures during teenage</h3>
 <p>A recent study found in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research reported that children in their pre-school days who 
 are overweight and have a body mass index which is more than the normal range, measures at preschool<br>
 age were more likely than were normal weight children to suffer upper- and lower-limb fractures before age 15 years. 
 This is a data researched on almost 470,000 children.<br>
 According to Jennifer C.E. Lane, MD, of the University of Oxford (England), and colleagues, 
 “A focused study of the association between preschool obesity and fracture risk offers the opportunity to better<br>
 understand the impact of obesity in early life.” The investigators reviewed data from 296 primary care centers from 2003-2013.
 The kids were evaluated starting at age 4 years and followed until age 15 years. The median follow-up time was 4.9 years, and <br>
 49% of the children were girls. BMI categories determined via the World Health Organization stated that
  −2 BMI z score meant underweight, −2 to +2 BMI z score stated normal weight and  +3 BMI z score stated obese weight.<br>
 Overall, children with a BMI in the overweight or obese ranges at first assessment were more likely to<br>
 suffer lower-limb fractures upper-limb fractures during the follow-up period.</p>
